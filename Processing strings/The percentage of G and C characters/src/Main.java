/**
 * GC-content is an important feature of the genome sequences and is defined as the percentage ratio of the sum of all
 * guanines and cytosines to the overall number of nucleic bases in the genome sequence.
 *
 * Write a program, which calculates the percentage of G characters (guanine) and C characters (cytosine) in the entered
 * string. Your program should be case independent.
 *
 * For example, in the string "acggtgttat" the percentage of characters G and C equals to 410â‹…100=40.0, where 4 is the
 * number of symbols G and C, and 10 is the length of the string.
 *
 * Note, answer should be double.
